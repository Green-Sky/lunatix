 
# NGC group history sync

## specification and workflow

* trigger: `tox_group_peer_join_cb()`

each time a peer joins we ask that peer to send all non-private group chat messages
from 130 minutes ago up to now.

to make sure that peer is actually really online (tox has a bit of an issue there), wait `n` seconds before sending `ngch_request`

`n` = 9 + random(0 .. 7)

* `ngch_request` packet data:

| what      | Length in bytes| Contents         |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| magic     |       6        |  0x667788113435  |
| version   |       1        |  0x01            |
| pkt id    |       1        |  0x01            |
| sync delta|       1        |  how many minutes back from now() to get messages <br> allowed values from 5 to 130 minutes (both inclusive)         |


* trigger: `tox_group_custom_private_packet_cb()` and it's the `ngch_request` packet

the tox client needs to get **authorization** from the user that it's ok to
share group chat history with the requesting peer

then we send all non-private group chats messages from 130 minutes ago up to now
sorted by oldest (first) to newest (last)
each message is sent as a seperate **lossless** custom packet

wait `n` milliseconds seconds before sending the next message.

`n` = 300 + random(0 .. 300)

* `ngch_syncmsg` packet data:

for text messages:

MAX_GC_CUSTOM_PACKET_SIZE 40000<br>
header_size = 6 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 32 + 4 + 25 = 73<br>
max sync message text bytes = MAX_GC_CUSTOM_PACKET_SIZE - header_size = 39927<br>

* trigger: `tox_group_custom_private_packet_cb()` and it's the `ngch_syncmsg` packet

the tox client needs to sort these messages into the group chat view
since the dates can be in the past and newer messages can already be present in the current uservisible view.

* duplicate message check:

if a message with that `msg id` for this group chat and this `sender` within the last 300 days already exists,
then assume it is a duplicate and keep the current message and discard the incoming sync message.

* cutoff UTF-8

since `name` could have been cut at the maximum byte limit, the tox client needs to check for cut off UTF-8 and handle this accordingly.
